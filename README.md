### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to create my own thoughts about anything which comes to my notice and I think we should always have our own thinking on everything rather than just following what others think. Thatâ€™s why 

I share my notes and my thoughts on my blog [ProgrammingMitra](https://www.programmingmitra.com) and keep the related code in [articles](https://github.com/njnareshjoshi/articles) and [exercises](https://github.com/njnareshjoshi/exercises) repositories.
