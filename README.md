### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to create my own thoughts about anything which comes to my notice and I think we should always have our own thinking on everything rather than just following what others think.

Thatâ€™s why I have started writing this blog to keep all my research notes and my thoughts regarding Java programming language in one place and make them available to others.
